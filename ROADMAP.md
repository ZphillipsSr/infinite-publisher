\## 🔧 MISSING CORE FEATURES (NEAR-TERM)

These should be implemented next for a polished MVP:



\- \[ ] Delete project  

\- \[ ] Rename project  

\- \[ ] Duplicate project  

\- \[ ] Export/import full project (`.json`)

\- \[ ] Undo/redo in editor (basic)

\- \[ ] “Save As New Project” option

\- \[ ] Pagination preview (approx)

\- \[ ] Better PDF extraction (images, layout)

\- \[ ] EPUB export

\- \[ ] Local offline mode fallback (no server needed)

\- \[ ] Improved error overlays in UI



---



\## 🚀 NEAR-TERM UPGRADES (ENHANCEMENTS)

These expand the capabilities significantly:



\- \[ ] Style Profile Analyzer (AI-generated)

\- \[ ] AI Chapter Consistency Checker

\- \[ ] AI Tone/Voice Harmonizer

\- \[ ] Rewrite presets system (customizable)

\- \[ ] Replace current editor with rich text editor (TipTap or Lexical)

\- \[ ] Auto-history of manuscript edits (like Google Docs versions)

\- \[ ] Manuscript diff view (“before vs after” for rewrites)

\- \[ ] Enhanced PDF \& EPUB import (image OCR support)

\- \[ ] Batch imports (multiple files → one manuscript)

\- \[ ] Cloud sync (optional)



---



\## 🌐 AI SYSTEM EXPANSIONS

Future AI enhancements:



\- \[ ] Multi-agent architecture  

&nbsp; - One agent: structure analysis  

&nbsp; - One agent: style/voice  

&nbsp; - One agent: quality check  

\- \[ ] AI-driven summary for each chapter  

\- \[ ] AI “gap finder” (detect missing transitions, pacing issues)

\- \[ ] AI “rewrite whole chapter” mode

\- \[ ] AI KDP Keyword generator

\- \[ ] AI Query Letter generator

\- \[ ] AI Social Media Promo generator (posts, captions, images)



---



\## 🎨 UI / UX IDEAS (VISUALLY STUNNING)

Potential visual upgrades:



\- \[ ] Side-by-side editor + insights panel

\- \[ ] Right-side AI assistant panel (dockable)

\- \[ ] Chapter navigator sidebar (auto-detect chapters)

\- \[ ] Modern floating toolbars

\- \[ ] Dark mode / Midnight Writer theme

\- \[ ] Zen Writing Mode (distraction-free)

\- \[ ] Animated transitions using Framer Motion

\- \[ ] Glassmorphism panels (frosted glass look)

\- \[ ] Heatmap of manuscript pacing (visual graph)

\- \[ ] Dashboard homepage with cards for each project

\- \[ ] Custom typography presets (Garamond, Literata, EB Garamond)



---



\## 🧱 ARCHITECTURE TODOS

Internal structural improvements:



\- \[x] Separate backend into routes/ and services/

\- \[ ] Extract AI code into dedicated /ai folder

\- \[ ] Add logging middleware

\- \[ ] Add unit tests for import, export, AI

\- \[ ] Add task queue for long jobs (exports, large imports)

\- \[ ] Switch to PostgreSQL or SQLite (optional future)

\- \[ ] Modular plugin system for future expansions



---



\## 🌙 FUTURE VISION (LONG-TERM)

Big ideas for future versions:



\- \[ ] Multi-format book builder (KDP, IngramSpark, Lulu, Google Books)

\- \[ ] Full cover designer with AI-generated art

\- \[ ] AI Audiobook narrator (text → voice)

\- \[ ] Co-author assistant (helps craft chapters collaboratively)

\- \[ ] Agent that updates itself (auto-optimizer)

\- \[ ] Marketplace for templates and add-ons

\- \[ ] Export entire project as ZIP workspace

\- \[ ] Multi-user collaboration (real-time)
